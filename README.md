This folder contains all the work done for the HPC exam, specifically:
	1. Python Scripts: it contains the Python code for generating graphs in the right format and plotting the results once gathered;
	2. Test Graphs: it contains all the generated graphs (Pattern and Token) used in the two algorithms;
	3. VF2pp MPI_Parallel: it contains the entire C MPI Parallel Project;
	4. VF2pp Serial: it contains the entire C Serial Project;
	5. HPC Mean Time: spreadsheet with all the computed means regarding the computational time of the two projects;
	6. Plots: directory containing all the plotted data used in the report.

Each project folder contains an additional README.txt containing further details about the program, plus some 
example macro to run them.
